## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# About me

Applied machine learning and computer vision practitioner. Focus on image understanding for realâ€‘world domains (e.g., agâ€‘tech and industrial). I design endâ€‘toâ€‘end pipelines from data to deployment.

Methods and tools
- Supervised deep learning: object detection, instance segmentation, keypoints, tracking
- Frameworks: PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLO, OpenCV, FastAPI
- Data ops: labeling, dataset curation, augmentation, batch inference
- Evaluation: mAP, mIoU, precision/recall, error analysis
- Deployment: REST services, batch jobs, edgeâ€‘friendly exports (ONNX/CoreML)

Open to collaborating on practical CV projects in agâ€‘tech and edge AI.
