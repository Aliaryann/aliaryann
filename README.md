# About me

Applied machine learning and computer vision practitioner. Focus on image understanding for real‑world domains (e.g., ag‑tech and industrial). I design end‑to‑end pipelines from data to deployment.

Methods and tools
- Supervised deep learning: object detection, instance segmentation, keypoints, tracking
- Frameworks: PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLO, OpenCV, FastAPI
- Data ops: labeling, dataset curation, augmentation, batch inference
- Evaluation: mAP, mIoU, precision/recall, error analysis
- Deployment: REST services, batch jobs, edge‑friendly exports (ONNX/CoreML)

Open to collaborating on practical CV projects in ag‑tech and edge AI.
